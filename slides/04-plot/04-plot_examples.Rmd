```{r setup, include=FALSE}
setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path))  # set working dir to current file location
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, 
                      cache = TRUE, autodep = TRUE)

## What's in the Star Wars data?

* How many rows and columns does this dataset have?
* What does each row represent?
* What does each column represent?

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
# ?starwars
glimpse(starwars)
```

A row for each person in the movies. For instance the row for Luke Skywalker is:

```{r, out.width="70%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/luke-skywalker.png")
```

## Scatterplot of mass vs. height

```{r out.width="70%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point()
```

Note a warning is issued. Not all characters have height and mass information (hence 28 of them not plotted). You may exclude warnings in chunk output by using option `warning = FALSE`. However, but often it's important to note it.


### Adding labels

The `labs` function can be used to add different labels to the plot.

```{r out.width="70%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Starwars characters",
       x = "Height (cm)", y = "Weight (kg)")            
```


### The fat guy

* How would you describe this relationship?
* What other variables would help us understand data points that don't follow the overall trend?
* Who is the not so tall but really chubby character?

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  filter(mass > 500) %>% 
  select(name, height, mass)
```



## Aesthetics

Visual characteristics of plotting can be **mapped to a specific variable** using aesthetics. For instance, the visual characteristics of plotting points are:

- `color`
- `size`
- `shape`
- `alpha` (transparency)

Let us have a look at mass vs. height using gender as color aesthetic:

```{r out.width="70%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, 
       mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender)) +
  geom_point()
```

In general not many girls in star wars. Let us add birth year as size aesthetic:

```{r out.width="70%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, 
       mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender, size = birth_year)) +
  geom_point()
```

Jabba is very old. What about species? We use species as color aesthetic:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Your turn - Finish the code
# ggplot(data = starwars, 
#        mapping = ___) +
#   geom_point()
```


Let's now increase the size of all points **not** based on the values of a variable in the data:

```{r out.width="70%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) 
```

A plot of mass given height with hair color as color aesthetic and using fixed `shape = 0`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Your turn: finish the code
# ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, ___)) +
#   geom_point(___) 
```

**Summary**


- Continuous variables are measured on a continuous scale.
- Discrete variables are measured (or often counted) on a discrete scale.
- Use aesthetics for mapping features of a plot to a variable.
- Define fixed features in the geom outside the `aes` function.

aesthetics | discrete                 | continuous                              
-----------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------
color      | rainbow of colors        | gradient
size       | discrete steps           | linear mapping between radius and value 
shape      | different shape for each | shouldn't (and doesn't) work


## Faceting

- Smaller plots that display different subsets of the data.
- Useful for exploring conditional relationships and large data.

```{r out.width="80%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ gender) +  # or use rows/cols argument
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Starwars characters",
       subtitle = "Faceted by gender")  
```

* Describe what each plot displays.
* Think about how the code relates to the output.

```{r out.width="90%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(gender ~ .)
```


```{r out.width="95%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ eye_color)
```

Let us facet species:

```{r}
# Your turn - Finish the code
```


**Summary**

- `facet_grid()`:
    - 2d grid
    - `rows ~ cols`
    - use `.` for no split
- `facet_wrap()`: 1d ribbon wrapped into 2d



## Identifying variables and plot type

- Univariate data analysis - distribution of single variable
- Bivariate data analysis - relationship between two variables
- Multivariate data analysis - relationship between many variables at once, usually focusing on the relationship between two while conditioning for others

There are different variable types:

- **Numerical variables** can be classified as **continuous** or **discrete** based on whether or not the variable can take on an infinite number of values or only non-negative whole numbers, respectively.
- If the variable is **categorical**, we can determine if it is **ordinal** based on whether or not the levels have a natural ordering.

## Visualizing numerical data

Describing shapes of numerical distributions

- shape:
    - skewness: right-skewed, left-skewed, symmetric (skew is to the side of the longer tail)
    - modality: unimodal, bimodal, multimodal, uniform
- center: mean (`mean`), median (`median`), mode (not always useful)
- spread: range (`range`), standard deviation (`sd`), inter-quartile range (`IQR`)
- unusal observations


### Histograms

```{r out.width="75%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10)
```


### Density plots

```{r out.width="75%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height)) +
  geom_density()
```



## Visualizing categorical data

### Bar plots

```{r out.width="80%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = gender)) +
  geom_bar()
```


### Segmented bar plots, counts

```{r out.width="80%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = gender, fill = hair_color)) +
  geom_bar()
```


Let us recode hair color into a smaller set:

```{r}
starwars <- starwars %>%
  mutate(hair_color2 = 
           fct_other(hair_color, 
                     keep = c("black", "brown", "brown", "blond")
                     )
         )
```

The segmented bar plot now becomes

```{r out.width="70%"}
# Your turn - Finish the code
# ggplot(data = starwars, 
#        mapping = aes(x = gender, fill = ___)) +
#   geom_bar() +
#   coord_flip()
```

Try to run the following:

```{r out.width="70%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, 
       mapping = aes(x = gender, fill = hair_color2)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(y = "proportion")
```

Which bar plot is a more useful representation for visualizing the relationship between gender and hair color?



## Visualizing relationships between numerical and categorical data

### Side-by-side box plots

```{r out.width="75%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(y = height, x = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

### Scatter plot...

This is not a great representation of these data.

```{r out.width="60%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(y = height, x = gender)) +
  geom_point()
```


### Violin plots

```{r out.width="75%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(y = height, x = gender)) +
  geom_violin()
```


### Jitter plot

```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1234)
```

```{r out.width="75%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(y = height, x = gender)) +
  geom_jitter()
```

What does `geom_gitter` do? 

### Scatterplot as columns

What is the average height for each species?

```{r}
dat <- starwars %>%
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(avg = mean(height, na.rm = T))
```

Let us visualize it

```{r}
dat %>% ggplot(aes(x = species, y = avg)) + 
  geom_col()
```
Let us sort the columns, add labels and rotate the x-axis labels:

```{r}
dat %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(species, avg), y = avg)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(title = "Average height of each species",
       x = "Species",
       y = "Avg. height"
    ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```


## Visualizing relationships between numerical and numerical data

### Scatterplot

```{r}
starwars_without_jabba <- starwars %>% filter(mass < 500)
```

```{r out.width="75%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(starwars_without_jabba, aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point()
```

Let us try to add some lines

```{r}
ggplot(starwars_without_jabba, aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red")
```
