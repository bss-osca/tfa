<!-- - Always try to use parentheses when you call subs and functions, e.g. `dtmTime = Now` will give the same result as `dtmTime = Now()` (it is not always possible when you call subs with no input). -->
<!-- - Indent you code using the default standard -->
<!-- - Specify return type of functions  -->
<!-- - Make procedures private whenever possible -->
<!-- - Always use `Option Explicit` (can be se under Tools-Options: "Require variable declaration" in the VBA editor) -->


## What is VBA

- A programming language intended to control and automate Microsoft Office applications (we use Excel).
- VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) is an implementation of BASIC developed by Microsoft. 
- A [compiled language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language#:~:text=A%20compiled%20language%20is%20a,%2Druntime%20translation%20takes%20place). That is, code need to be compiled first before running it. 
- You can only run VBA using the desktop version of Excel (not the web version). MS doesn't support VBA in MS 365.
- With VBA you can extend Excel and automate tasks by coding different algorithms that for instance can be run by pressing a button.

## Setting up Excel for VBA

.midi[
Use an English version of Excel, so the menus and Excel functions are in English! 

- `r icons::fontawesome$brands$apple`: **System settings > General > Language & Region** and add _English_ as primary language. 
- `r icons::fontawesome$brands$windows`: **File > Options > Language** in Excel and under **Office display Language** choose English.

For running VBA code the **Developer** tab needs to be visible in Excel. This can be done by check marking the **Developer** tab under the 'Ribbon and Toolbar' options in Excel. You find it by choosing **Excel -> Preferences -> Ribbon and toolbar** (`r icons::fontawesome$brands$apple`) or right click a tab and choose **Customize ribbon ...** (`r icons::fontawesome$brands$windows`).

In the **Developer** tab you open the VBA editor by pressing the **Visual basic** button (`r icons::fontawesome$brands$windows` Alt + F11, `r icons::fontawesome$brands$apple` ⌥ + F11).

A few useful shortcuts:

- Toggle VBA editor and Excel (`r icons::fontawesome$brands$windows` Alt + F11, `r icons::fontawesome$brands$apple` ⌘⇧´).
- Run current procedure or continues execution after pausing (F5).
- Auto complete code (Ctrl + Space).
- Switch between subs/functions (Ctrl + Up/Down).
- Use the debugger (F8).
]
<!-- - How to avoid the enable macros dialog? If you have your Excel macro files in a trusted location you can add this location as trusted under `Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings > Trusted locations`. -->
<!-- - How to avoid the "Be careful! Parts of your document may include personal information that can't be removed by the Document Inspector"? Go to `Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings > Privacy Options` and un-check the check box that says "Remove personal information from file properties on save". -->

## Let us try it out

.midi[
An __algorithm__ is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions to solve a specific problem or to perform a computation. Let us try to program [this algorithm](https://github.com/bss-osca/tfa/blob/master/vba/vba-groups.xlsm) written in pseudo code:

.instructions[
**Precondition**: A list of student names including e-mail and study program.

**Postcondition**: A list of groups with 3-6 persons.

	For each program category do							
		While students not allocated do						
			Let n = number of students not allocated					
			If n >= 10 allocate the first 5 students to a group					
			Else if n = 5 or 6 create a group with the persons					
			Else if n = 7 to 10 split the remaining students into two groups					
	Return the student names of each group
]]

## Say Hello World

Let us try to create our first procedure in VBA. Download the template file and 

1. Add a new module by clicking the *Insert Module* icon.
2. Rename the module (named *Module1*) to *`r str_c("TM", module_number, "_", "hello")`* (note you have to use underscores).
3. Open the module by double clicking on the module in the Process Explorer.
4. Add the code 
   ```
   ' Your first program/macro
   Sub TM2_SayHello()
       MsgBox ("Say hello world :-)")
   End Sub
   ```
5. Run the code using the "Play" button or F5.
6. Add a button that run the procedure to the sheet *TM2*.

## The macro recorder

Good idea as supplement to coding in the following cases:
- Forgot syntax for font, format, color etc.
- Help to make charts

Note: Recorded code must be cleaned up and often changed. In many other cases, recording is NOT a good idea.

Always indicate in your VBA code when something is recorded!
  ```
  ' Start of recorded code
  ...
  
  ' End of recorded code
  ```

Have a look at the sub `TM2_MacroRecorder` in the template file.

## Basic building blocks in programming

- _Variables_ store stuff in memory.
- _Procedures_ (functions and subs) execute a set of instructions.
- _Conditional statements_ are used to execute different instructions depending on a true/false statement.
- _Loops_ are used to execute code repeatedly. 
- _Input/output_ are needed to read data and output the result.

---

## Variables

.pull-left[
- Variables are used to store information in the program.
- A variable is a box that can contain 
  - A number
  - A string of text
  - A date
  - An array of integers
- The variable name is the label on the box.
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="120%", fig.cap="Computer memory"} 
knitr::include_graphics("./img/storage.jpg", dpi = 250) 
```
]

---

## Basic datatypes

A selected set of datatypes are (see all in the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/reference/user-interface-help/data-type-summary)):

Name    | Type      | Details                                                                        
------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Byte    | Numerical | Whole number between 0 and 255.                                                
Integer | Numerical | Whole number between -32'768 and 32'767.                                       
Long    | Numerical | Whole number between - 2'147'483'648 and 2'147'483'647.                        
Double  | Numerical | Floating decimal number between -1.79769313486232E308 and 1.79769313486232E308.
String  | Text      | Text.                                                                          
Date    | Date      | Date and time.                                                                 
Boolean | Boolean   | True or False.                                                                 
Variant | Any type  | Any kind of data (default type if the variable is not declared). 

---

## Memory

.midi[
- Variables take up different storage place in memory. 
- Memory consists of bits (0/1). 1 Bit = Binary Digit, 8 Bits = 1 Byte, 1024 Bytes = 1 Kilobyte, 1024 Kilobytes = 1 Megabyte, 1024 Megabytes = 1 Gigabyte, 1024 Gigabytes = 1 Terabyte.
- Size of selected datatypes:


Data type                                 | Storage size            
----------------------------------------- | ------------------------
Boolean                                   | 2 bytes                 
Integer                                   | 2 bytes                 
Long  (long integer)                      | 4 bytes                 
Double  (double-precision floating-point) | 8 bytes                 
String                                    | 10 bytes + string length * 2 bytes
Variant  (with numbers)                   | 16 bytes                
Variant  (with characters)                | 22 bytes + string length * 2 bytes
]

- Declaring variables is good coding practice since it reduces the memory requirements and avoid type errors (use `Option explicit`).

---

## Declare variables

Variables must be declared by

  ```
  Dim {variable name} As {data type}
  ```

Example:
  ```
  Dim intC As Integer		
  intC = 2
  Dim dblCost As Double		
  dblCost = 2.45
  ```

Run the procedure `TM2_DeclareVariables` in the Excel file.

---

## Procedures

In VBA we deal with two kinds of procedures:

- A `Sub` which can work as a “macro” in Excel, i.e. we can call it using e.g. a button. 
  ```
  Sub SubName(input As integer)
      ...
  End Sub
  ```
- A `Function` which can work like Excel functions, i.e. return a value.
  ```
  Function FunctionName(input As String) As String
      ...
  End Function
  ```

Have a look at the function `TM2_StringJoin` in the Excel file.

---

## Using built-in functions

Three types of functions:

- Functions that are build into VBA
- Excel functions (Worksheet/application functions)
- Custom functions (yours or mine)
  ```
  Now()  ' VBA function - Date and time right now  
  Rnd()  ' VBA function - Random number between 0 and 1
  WorksheetFunction.Sum(Range("D2:E5"))  ' Excel function - Sum of range
  ```

Have a look at the sub `TM2_ExcelFunction` and `TM2_VBAFunction` in the Excel file.

---

## Communicate with the user

- Simple message box: 
  ```
  MsgBox(“You are done!”)
  ```
- More advanced message box:
  ```
  intAns = MsgBox("Delete Sheet 1 permanently?", vbOKCancel + vbQuestion)
  ```
  Different buttons and their value can be seen in the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/reference/user-interface-help/msgbox-function)
- Input box:
  ```
  strAns = InputBox("What is your name?")
  ```
  Return what is typed in as a string (if press Cancel then return an empty string)

Have a look at the sub `TM2_Dialog` in the Excel file.

---

## Input/output

You can use `Range` to read/write to a sheet:

  ```
  Range("B7") = 107      ' Write 107 in cell B7
  Range("H1") = "Test"   ' Write Test in cell H1
  Range("T4") = x        ' Write value of varible x in cell T4
  x = Range("B7)         ' Set x equal to value in cell B7 
  ```

You must know which sheet you are considering (above the active one). Always refer to a sheet:

  ```
  Worksheets("Groups").Range("B7") = 107   ' Write 107 in B7 in sheet Groups
  ```

As an alternative you may use `Cells`:

  ```
  Cells(2,3) = 107  ' Write 107 to cell in row 2 and column 3 (C2) 
  ```

Have a look at the sub `TM2_ReadWriteSheet` in the Excel file.

---

## Conditional statements (decisions) 

We can execute different instructions depending on a true/false statement. An example with an if statement:

```
If int < 7 Then
  MsgBox("Number is less than 7.")
ElseIf int == 7
  MsgBox("Number is 7.")
Else
  MsgBox("Number is greater than 7.")
End If
```

Have a look at the sub `TM2_CondStatement` in the Excel file.

---

## Loops 

Used to execute code repeatedly:

  ```
  Sub Loops()
    For i = 1 To 3
  	  MsgBox(i)
    Next
  End Sub
  ```

Have a look at the sub `TM2_Loops` in the Excel file.


```{r copy to docs, include=FALSE}
file.copy(list.files(pattern = ".html"), "../docs/slides/", overwrite = T)
file.copy("./slides.css", "./libs/", overwrite = T)
file.copy("libs", "../docs/slides/", recursive = T)
file.copy("img", "../docs/slides/", recursive = T)
system2("Rscript", args = "-e 'rmarkdown::render(\"index.Rmd\", quiet = TRUE)'")
```
